My First Project
# 3D Quote Generator

## My First Web Development Project

Hello! I'm excited to share my very first web development project. This simple but fun application displays random quotes in a visually appealing 3D-style container.

## Features

- Fetches random quotes from an online API
- Displays quotes in a stylish 3D container
- Responsive design with a gradient background
- "New Quote" button to generate fresh quotes

## How It Works

When you load the page or click the "New Quote" button, the app fetches a random quote from the internet and displays it in the 3D container. The container has a cool hover effect too!
